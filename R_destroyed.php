<p>Various game effects can cause a unit to be destroyed. When a player&rsquo;s unit is destroyed, it is removed from the game board and returned to their reinforcements.</p>
    <ol class="lrr">
    <li>When a player assigns hits that were produced against their units, that player chooses a number of their units to be destroyed equal to the number of hits produced against those units.</li>
    <li>If a player&rsquo;s unit is removed from the board by a game effect, it is not treated as being destroyed; effects that trigger when a unit is destroyed are not triggered.</li>
