<h2>Ion Storm</h2>

    <li>The active player chooses which side of the Ion Storm token is initially face up.</li>
    <li>All ship movement is simultaneous.

    <ol><li>The Creuss player may do this by moving their <i>Hil Colish</i> flagship before or after their other ships.</li></ol>
    <li>If the Ion Storm token is in a system containing a wormhole of the same type, a player chooses which wormhole they use when moving through a wormhole of that type. The Ion Storm token only flips if it was the chosen wormhole.</li>
    <ol><li>As a system is never adjacent to itself, a ship cannot move out through one wormhole and in through the other while remaining in the system. The ship must pass through another system with a wormhole to use both wormholes.</li></ol>
    <li>If ships are moved through the Ion Storm token wormhole outside of the <b>Move Ship</b> or <b>Retreat</b> substeps of a tactical action, such as by the effect of the <i>Skilled Retreat</i> action card, the Ion Storm token is not flipped.</li>
